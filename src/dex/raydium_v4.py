"""Minimal Raydium v4 helpers.

The production project performs complex PDA derivations and instruction
construction for Raydium's AMM.  Re‑implementing the full logic would add a lot
of noise to the educational version of this repository.  Instead we provide
light‑weight helpers that expose the expected interfaces and produce
deterministic placeholder values.  This keeps the higher level orchestration
code testable without requiring a connection to the Solana network.
